# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
the commas after each value inside the object. I could NOT remember to put them in. I would forget one after basically every line. Very upsetting

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Note taking is going ~OK~ I always struggle with that dedgree of clarity my notes need. I can gerenally understand/memorize concepts without detailed notes but I think I might benifit from having more readable and indepth notes. This came up in HS in geometry class. When we were supposed to do proofs I struggled because while I need what to do and got the right answers, I'd struggle with writing down something into words that happened really fast inside my brain. 

I did find mysekf taking very detailed notes I will look at when it comes names of different parts of code. likelabing keys vs delcaring functions etc.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I like to solve it on my own as much as I can. Otherwise I find stack Over flow or YOutube to be the most useful.
